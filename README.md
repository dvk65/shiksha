# shiksha
This repository includes code to automate data collection from shiksha.com<br>
First it accesses the url provided in the code.<br>
Then it scrapes the title, subtitle, the dates and descriptions, and finally the links at the bottom.<br>
This information is stored in separate lists.<br>
These lists are then used to store the information in an excel file.<br>
The right arrow is clicked at the bottom of the page to go to the next page.<br>
This process is repeated till all the pages are scraped.
