# shiksha
This repository includes code to automate data collection from shiksha.com
First it accesses the url provided in the code.
Then it scrapes the title, subtitle, the dates and descriptions, and finally the links at the bottom.
This information is stored in separate lists.
These lists are then used to store the information in an excel file.
The right arrow is clicked at the bottom of the page to go to the next page.
This process is repeated till all the pages are scraped.
